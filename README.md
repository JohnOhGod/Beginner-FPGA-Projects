# Beginner-FPGA-Projects
These are my first FPGA projects. For the most part, they are fairly basic, and in some cases are adaptations of publicly available online projects. All of these projects were designed either for the Pynq Z2 or the Nexys A7 100T.

All projects include references to any source material which projects are based on.
